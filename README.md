# Multi Signature Ethereum Wallet

## About The Project

Ethereum wallets are cryptocurrency wallets used on the Ethereum Blockchain to store digital assets/tokens, providing
the ability to transfer assets/tokens from one wallet to another.

This project details a Multi-sig wallet smart contract, which is a programmatic solution to the debatable insecurities
surrounding an Ethereum wallet. The smart contract ensures that a transaction between the wallet and the target
Ethereum account, can only be done once consensus has been reached by the multiple owners. This means that a
transaction from the wallet is only valid once multiple people confirm the funds can be transferred.
